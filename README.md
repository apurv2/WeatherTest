# WeatherTest

functionality:
--Works on all devices above 2.1, but works better on 4.1 +


--When the app is launched, the app fetches gps location and weatherdata automatically. It asks for required permissions and settings
to the user when it launches. (Especially Marshmallow app permissions and gps enable functionality)

--The Action bar on the homeScreen contains text field to enter zip code. When no input is given and the adjacent search button is clicked,
the device fetches default GPS location and fetches weather data.

--To get weather data for a particular lcoation, enter zip code into the text field on the action bar and press on 
the serarch button.1

known issues:
--Geocoding service does not reliably work on older emulators but works on all devices.
